# Immortals Mod by fridgeBaron

Changes:
- Added HotSwappable attribute https://github.com/Zetrith/HotSwap (Code hotswapping utility for the RimWorld game.) 
- added Publicizer nuget package to access private methods and members
- added Harmony as nuget package
- fixed the bug with first death immortals not reviving after save load (CanHeadl, > 0.1)
- added the designators to the reverse designators; that way the designator can be used and it also appears as gizmo like ExtractSkull
- made the designators dependand on "IsVisibleImmortal"
- added somme code (commented out) so that only immortal pawns behead (WeorkGiver_Behead)
- added a corpse filter (humans only) for immortals/mortals
